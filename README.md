# fake-news-headline-generator
# Fake News Headline Generator    This is a small Python project that generates funny and random fake news headlines.   It picks a random subject, action, and place/thing to create a hilarious news-style headline.    Run the script, and it will keep generating headlines until you type `no` to stop.
